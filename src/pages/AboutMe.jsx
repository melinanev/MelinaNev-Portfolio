      <p id="aboutme">
        I'm a problem-solver at heart with a passion for both technology and veterinary medicine. 
        I'm currently a student at the University of Denver, expanding my skills in full-stack development 
        and business operations while leveraging over 20 years of experience in the veterinary industry. 
        As a registered veterinary technician turned business operations leader, I've worn many 
        hatsâ€” managing hospital efficiency, optimizing software workflows, and guiding teams toward success. 
        My work spans clinical practice, consulting, and software development, always with a focus on 
        efficiency, innovation and practicality. Whether it's streamlining operations, enhancing user experiences, 
        or tackling complex business challenges, I bring a strategic and hands-on approach to everything 
        I do. When I'm not deep in problem-solving mode, you'll probably find me enjoying a cup of coffee, 
        diving into a good horror movie, or exploring the latest in tech and business strategy.
        Let's connect and build something great!
